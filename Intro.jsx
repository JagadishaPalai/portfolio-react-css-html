        <p>
          I grew up in Bhadrak, a small village in Ertal, Odisha,
          surrounded by the pleasant sounds of good music in our home. My life
          has been shaped by the strong bonds of family and the influence of
          music. For my college education, I attended Mordern Engineering 
          Management Studies College, where I earned a Bachelor of Technology degree in
          Electrical Engineering.
